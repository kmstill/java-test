# java-test
This is for a test I completed on java file IO and creating a simple HTTP Server. 

To run the application for each task, simply run the main method of Task1.java, Task2.java, and Task3.java

The following command line arguments must be provided:
Task 1
  -an integer representing the number of random numbers to be written to the file. 
  -a file path specifying the file that the random numbers should be written to. 
Task 2
  -a file path specifying the file to read the numbers from.
  -optionally, a string "asc" or "desc" to specify whether the numbers should be printed in ascending or descending order.
Task 3
  -an integer representing the port number for the HTTP Server. 
  -a file path specifying the desired document root file path for the HTTP Server.

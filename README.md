# java-test
This is for a test I completed on java file IO and creating a simple HTTP Server. <br />

To run the application for each task, simply run the main method of Task1.java, Task2.java, and Task3.java <br />

The following command line arguments must be provided: <br />
Task 1<br />
  -an integer representing the number of random numbers to be written to the file. <br />
  -a file path specifying the file that the random numbers should be written to. <br />
Task 2<br />
  -a file path specifying the file to read the numbers from. <br />
  -optionally, a string "asc" or "desc" to specify whether the numbers should be printed in ascending or descending order. <br />
Task 3<br />
  -an integer representing the port number for the HTTP Server. <br />
  -a file path specifying the desired document root file path for the HTTP Server. <br />
  
 The file Task1.java pertains to Task 1. <br />
 The file Task2.java pertains to Task 2.<br />
 The files Task3.java, HttpConnectionWorkerThread.java and ServerListenerThread.java pertain to Task 3.
